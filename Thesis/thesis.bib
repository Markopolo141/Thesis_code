abstract={Nodal prices, congestion revenues, transmission capacity rights, and compensation for wire ownership are key concepts used to formulate claims about proposals to organize competitive and open transmission access. Underlying those claims are implicit assertions (folk theorems) concerning the regulation of transmission access, the determination of power flows, properties of economic dispatch, and the operations of competitive nodal markets for power. The paper has two objectives. We first formulate these folk theorems as explicit mathematical assertions. We then prove that some of these assertions are true, and we present counterexamples to other assertions.},

abstract = {Local flexibility markets have a substantial potential to unlock the flexibility of distributed energy resources in the distribution level. Capacity limitation services have been perceived as one of the most appealing products to be traded in these markets. This work argues why classical market-clearing and pricing mechanisms such as pay-as-bid, uniform pricing and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) are not compatible with a market that trades capacity limitations. As a solution, we propose a local flexibility market mechanism which is built upon an adapted VCG-based auction. The mechanism achieves a trade-off among various desirable economic properties, including budget-balancedness, incentive-compatibility and stability. The suitability of the proposed mechanism is illustrated using a case study which is based on a real medium voltage feeder, located on the Danish island of Bornholm. Results show that aggregators and the distribution system operator benefit from the trade of capacity limitation services. We eventually conclude by providing a set of policy recommendations for the real-life operation of such a market.}

abstract="In this chapter, the mechanism designs for sharing economy in wholesale and retail markets are investigated. In wholesale markets, according to generation adequacy, we firstly categorize electricity markets into three stages: the market tends to be perfectly competitive; the generation tends to be inadequate but the N − 1 capacity is still sufficient; and the N − 1 capacity of generating units is even insufficient. When the N − 1 capacity of the generating units is sufficient, the payment function for profit-sharing settlement is designed to be the substitution benefit of one unit to other units. Based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) theory, such a mechanism achieves incentive compatibility, thus eliciting truthfulness. When the N − 1 capacity of generator units is insufficient, we use generators' historical bids as an index to set the price cap for manipulation mitigation. In retail markets, the traditional centralized-bidding market can hardly work for large-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) due to high transaction costs and inconvenience caused by frequently bidding. Therefore, a bidding-free profit sharing mechanism based on Nash bargaining is proposed to evaluate the contribution rate of each DER while achieving benefit allocation.",

abstract = {This paper discusses the importance and challenges of incentivizing flexibility during short-term operations of the bulk power system due to the increasing variability and uncertainty from growing penetrations of variable generation (VG). Operational flexibility can refer to many aspects of a resource’s capability to support the power system, such as the speed, range, and duration of power output, as well as the ability to autonomously respond to frequency or voltage changes. Inefficient utilization of existing flexibility, or unwillingness of resources to provide flexibility, can compromise system reliability by not meeting the changing net load, and it can also lead to higher costs when an inefficient use of flexibility resources occurs. There are many existing characteristics of market design that incentivize flexibility in some manner. How they incentivize the provision of flexibility as well as the level of flexibility is still debated. We explore some of these existing market designs, as well as new market mechanisms, such as pay-for-performance regulating reserve and flexible ramping products, that aim to explicitly incentivize the provision of more flexibility to the system, particularly as a result of increasing VG penetration levels.}

abstract = {We model the economic incentives for market participants to cooperate in the development of a microgrid in a small electricity network served by a regulated utility. The microgrid can provide energy, ancillary services, heat and enhanced reliability to its customers. Using the framework of cooperative game theory, assuming exchangeable utility and full public information, we quantify how microgrid development affects prices, costs and benefits for parties in the network under alternative sets of assumptions. Our analysis yields three main results. First, market failures mean that the misalignment between the social objective (market efficiency) and objectives of private parties (profit maximization and consumer surplus maximization) can incent investment in inefficient scale and types of microgrid installations. We discuss how regulators can facilitate the realization of efficient market outcomes. Second, if the regulator does not correctly anticipate the timing of microgrid introduction and does not account for it in the rate-making process, social benefits associated with microgrid development could be lower and suboptimal investments may take place, relative to the case in which there is no regulatory lag. Third, utility customers could reap most of the benefits of microgrid introduction, if microgrids result in lower electric rates for all customers. However, when regulated prices are above the marginal cost of power provided by the utility, introducing microgrids can instead raise rates and the resulting economic losses to utility customers might exceed the economic gains to the microgrid owner and its consumers. Our study shows how the cooperative game framework can be useful to regulators and policy makers for identifying the beneficiaries of microgrid promotion policies, and for correcting the market failures in utility pricing that can distort incentives for microgrid investment.}

ABSTRACT = {Uncertainties are the most significant challenges in the smart power system, necessitating the use of precise techniques to deal with them properly. Such problems could be effectively solved using a probabilistic optimization strategy. It is further divided into stochastic, robust, distributionally robust, and chance-constrained optimizations. The topics of probabilistic optimization in smart power systems are covered in this review paper. In order to account for uncertainty in optimization processes, stochastic optimization is essential. Robust optimization is the most advanced approach to optimize a system under uncertainty, in which a deterministic, set-based uncertainty model is used instead of a stochastic one. The computational complexity of stochastic programming and the conservativeness of robust optimization are both reduced by distributionally robust optimization.Chance constrained algorithms help in solving the constraints optimization problems, where finite probability get violated. This review paper discusses microgrid and home energy management, demand-side management, unit commitment, microgrid integration, and economic dispatch as examples of applications of these techniques in smart power systems. Probabilistic mathematical models of different scenarios, for which deterministic approaches have been used in the literature, are also presented. Future research directions in a variety of smart power system domains are also presented.}

However, after the introduction of FTRs, the profit from transmission lines changes, and those changes affect the expansion of and investment in transmission lines. Therefore, this paper constructs a system dynamics analysis model and presents specific calculation methods and a case analysis. Load growth, construction time, congestion, the step nature of the bid from generating units, and relative changes in the locational marginal prices (LMPs) at the sink and source nodes under the expansion and non-expansion scenarios are considered for a simulation calculation of net present value of transmission expansion project. Sensitivity analyses of factors such as generator bid prices, transmission expansion costs, the proportion of expansion capacity to transmission congestion, and the market maturity of FTRs are analysed. The results show that decision-making on the basis of transmission expansion investment in combination with FTRs is feasible and such decision-making can reflect the value of transmission expansion via the market, which conforms to market rules. That decision-making method is very important for the marketisation of power transmission.}

Theoretically, it is demonstrated that in the presence of strategic interaction, the generator optimal bidding strategy and the market clearing price are higher under PABP as compared with MP. In addition, the probability distribution patterns of expected loss and profit of each generator are constructed by simulating a multiperiod market under PABP and MP rules. It is shown that a generator has a higher expected loss or profit under PABP in unconstrained networks. However, the generator may gain less expected loss or profit if its physical location or transmission limitations are considered.}

ABSTRACT = {Energy reforms play an essential role in technological change as they aim to contribute to an open market: costs reduction, competitiveness, and technology development. This article seeks to assess the impact and effect of reforms on the energy sector. The article’s objective is to evaluate the process of deregulation policies and their micro and macroeconomic effects on the energy sector, and specifically on electricity, by analyzing literature related to electricity reforms. Further, the article intends to explore the impacts of deregulation on power pricing, power market, electricity accessibility, innovation, and competitiveness. Another objective of the article is to analyze the role played by various stakeholders in the deregulation policies, including the government, national entities like states, the private sector, and consumers. The article identified ways to improve the economic impacts of deregulation policies in the energy sector. After a systemic review of specialized articles regarding their theoretical approach, results showed a positive relationship between reform and innovation, competitiveness, opening-up of the market, technology, and price changes. Although deregulation measures aimed to reduce the consumers’ electricity cost, the changes in power prices were achievable only in the long-term and not in the short-term. Additionally, government regulators and stakeholders participated in implementing various measures to ensure that deregulation achieved its primary objective of reducing power prices. Such efforts include developing divestiture policies and implementing rate cuts.}

We propose a new desirable property, the meta-envy-freeness of cake-cutting, which has not been formally considered before. Though envy-freeness was considered to be one of the most important desirable properties, envy-freeness does not prevent envy about role assignment in the protocols. We define meta-envy-freeness that formalizes this kind of envy. We show that current envy-free cake-cutting protocols do not satisfy meta-envy-freeness. Formerly proposed properties such as strong envy-free, exact, and equitable do not directly consider this type of envy and these properties are very difficult to realize. This paper then shows meta-envy-free cake-cutting protocols for two and three party cases.",

We ask whether bounded protocols exist when the agents' preferences are restricted.

CCEA is polynomial-time, robust envy-free, and non-wasteful. Then, we show that there exists an algorithm (MEA) that is polynomial-time, envy-free, proportional, and Pareto optimal. Moreover, we show that for piecewise uniform valuations, MEA and CCEA are group-strategyproof and are equivalent to Mechanism 1 of Chen et. al.(2013). We then present an algorithm MCSD and a way to implement it via randomization that satisfies strategyproofness in expectation, robust proportionality, and unanimity for piecewise constant valuations. We also present impossibility results that show that the properties satisfied by CCEA and MEA are maximal subsets of properties that can be satisfied by any algorithm.",

abstract = {Cake cutting is a common metaphor for the division of a heterogeneous divisible good. There are numerous papers that study the problem of fairly dividing a cake; a small number of them also take into account self-interested agents and consequent strategic issues, but these papers focus on fairness and consider a strikingly weak notion of truthfulness. In this paper we investigate the problem of cutting a cake in a way that is truthful, Pareto-efficient, and fair, where for the first time our notion of dominant strategy truthfulness is the ubiquitous one in social choice and computer science. We design both deterministic and randomized cake cutting mechanisms that are truthful and fair under different assumptions with respect to the valuation functions of the agents.}

We show that no deterministic truthful envy-free mechanism exists in the connected piece scenario, and the same impossibility result for the general setting with some additional mild assumptions on the allocations. Finally, we study a large market model where the economy is replicated and demonstrate that truth-telling converges to a Nash equilibrium.},

Whether items are indivisible or divisible, it is impossible to achieve envy-freeness and Pareto Efficiency ex post even in the case of two people and two items. In contrast, in this work, we prove that, for any cardinal utility functions (including complementary utilities for example) and for any number of items and players, there always exists an ex ante mixed allocation which is envy-free and Pareto Efficient, assuming the allowable assignments satisfy an anonymity property. The problem remains open in the divisible case. We also investigate the communication complexity for finding a Pareto Efficient and envy-free allocation.}

Each player holds a private non-negative utility function that depends only on the amount of the good that he receives. We define the fair share of a player P to be the average utility that a player could receive if all players had the same utility function as P. We present a randomized allocation mechanism in which every player has a dominant strategy for maximizing his expected utility. Every player that follows his dominant strategy is guaranteed to receive an expected utility of at least n/(2n−1) of his fair share. This is best possible in the sense that there is a collection of utility functions with respect to which no allocation mechanism can guarantee a larger fraction of the fair share. In interesting special cases our allocation mechanism does offer a larger fraction of the fair share.}

abstract = {Often because of limitations in generation capacity of power stations, many developing countries frequently resort to disconnecting large parts of the power grid from supply, a process termed load shedding. This leaves households in disconnected parts without electricity, causing them inconvenience and discomfort. Without fairness being taken into due consideration during load shedding, some households may suffer more than others. In this paper, we solve the fair load shedding problem (FLSP) by creating solutions which connect households to supply based on some fairness criteria (i.e., to fairly connect homes to supply in terms of duration, their electricity needs, and their demand), which we model as their utilities. First, we briefly describe some state-of-art household-level load shedding heuristics which meet the first criteria. Second, we model the FLSP as a resource allocation problem, which we formulate into two Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problems based on the Multiple Knapsack Problem. In so doing, we use the utilitarian, egalitarian and envy-freeness social welfare metrics to develop objectives and constraints that ensure our FLSP solutions results in fair allocations that consider the utilities of agents. Then, we solve the FLSP and show that our MIP models maximize the groupwise and individual utilities of agents, and minimize the differences between their pairwise utilities under a number of experiments. When taken together, our endeavour establishes a set of benchmarks for fair load shedding schemes, and provide insights for designing fair allocation solutions for other scarce resources.},

abstract = {We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods to a set of people from an algorithmic perspective. fair division has been a central topic in the economic literature and several concepts of fairness have been suggested. The criterion that we focus on is envy-freeness. In our model, a monotone utility function is associated with every player specifying the value of each subset of the goods for the player. An allocation is envy-free if every player prefers her own share than the share of any other player. When the goods are divisible, envy-free allocations always exist. In the presence of indivisibilities, we show that there exist allocations in which the envy is bounded by the maximum marginal utility, and present a simple algorithm for computing such allocations. We then look at the optimization problem of finding an allocation with minimum possible envy. In the general case the problem is not solvable or approximable in polynomial time unless P = NP. We consider natural special cases (e.g.additive utilities) which are closely related to a class of job scheduling problems. Approximation algorithms as well as inapproximability results are obtained. Finally we investigate the problem of designing truthful mechanisms for producing allocations with bounded envy.},

abstract = {We consider a market setting in which buyers are individuals of a population, whose relationships are represented by an underlying social graph. Given buyers' valuations for the items being sold, an outcome consists of a pricing of the objects and an allocation of bundles to the buyers. An outcome is social envy-free if no buyer strictly prefers the bundles of her neighbors in the social graph. We focus on the revenue maximization problem in multi-unit markets, in which there are multiple copies of the same item being sold, and each buyer is assigned a subset of identical items. We consider four different cases that arise when considering two different buyers valuations, i.e., single-minded or general, and by adopting two different forms of pricing, that is item- or bundle-pricing. For all the above cases we show the hardness of the revenue maximization problem and give corresponding approximation results. All our approximation bounds are optimal or nearly optimal. Moreover, under the assumption of social graphs of bounded treewidth, we provide an optimal allocation algorithm for general valuations with item-pricing. Finally, we determine optimal bounds on the corresponding price of envy-freeness, that is on the worst-case ratio between the maximum revenue that can be achieved without envy-freeness constraints, and the one obtainable in case of social relationships. Some of our results close hardness open questions or improve already known ones in the literature concerning the standard setting without sociality.}

Unfortunately, allocations satisfying this criterion may not exist in the setting where the goods are assumed to be indivisible. In this case, it is useful to settle for allocations with envy as small as possible. Adapting the framework of Chevaleyre et al. (2007), we propose a multiplicative form of the degree of envy of a given allocation and then study the approximability of the corresponding envy minimization problems. We show that these problems are APX-hard to approximate in general, but admit an FPTAS for a fixed number of agents with additive utility functions. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for the case when the number of agents is equal to the number of goods to be distributed. In addition, we study the problem of maximizing social welfare by the average Nash product. We provide a fast greedy approximation algorithm for this problem when the agents’ utility functions are (sub)additive, and we design a PTAS for the case when all agents have the same additive utility function.}

In this work, we propose a new fairness notion, envy-freeness for mixed goods (EFM), which is a direct generalization of both EF and EF1 to the mixed goods setting. We prove that an EFM allocation always exists for any number of agents with additive valuations. We also propose efficient algorithms to compute an EFM allocation for two agents with general additive valuations and for n agents with piecewise linear valuations over the divisible goods. Finally, we relax the envy-freeness requirement, instead asking for ϵ-envy-freeness for mixed goods (ϵ-EFM), and present an efficient algorithm that finds an ϵ-EFM allocation.}

The mathematics literature has considered agents with utilities that are nonatomic measures over the commodity (and hence are additive). The existence of ‘α-fair’ allocations, in which each agent receives a utility proportional to his utility of the endowment of the entire economy, was demonstrated there. Here we extend these existence results to α-fair efficient allocations, envy-free allocations, envy-free efficient allocations, group envy-free and nicely shaped allocations of these types. We examine utilities that are not additive and relate the mathematics literature to the economics literature. We find sufficient conditions for the existence of egalitarian-equivalent efficient allocations. Finally, we consider the problem of allocating a time interval (uses of a facility). Existence of an envy-free allocation had been demonstrated in earlier literature. We show that any envy-free allocation is efficient as well as group envy-free. We extend this last result to a more general setting.}

abstract = "The high penetration of both Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and Demand Response (DR) in modern power systems requires a sequence of advanced strategies and technologies for maintaining system reliability and flexibility. Real-time electricity markets (RTM) are the non-discriminatory transaction platforms for providing necessary balancing services, where the market clearing (nodal or zonal prices depending on markets) is very close to real time operations of power systems. One of the primary functions of RTMs in modern power systems is establishing an efficient and effective mechanism for small DER and DR to participate in balancing market transactions, while handling their meteorological or intermittent characteristics, facilitating asset utilization, and stimulating their active responses. Consequently, RTMs are dedicated to maintaining the flexibility and reliability of power systems. This paper reviews advanced typical RTMs respectively in the North America, Australia and Europe, focusing on their market architectures and incentive policies for integrating DER and DR in electricity markets. In this paper, RTMs are classified into three groups: Group I applies nodal prices implemented by optimal power flow, which clears energy prices every 5min. Group II applies zonal prices, with the time resolution of 5-min. Group III is a general balancing market, which clears zonal prices intro-hourly. The various successful advanced RTM experiences have been summarized and discussed, which provides a technical overview of the present RTMs integrating DER and DR."

 abstract = {This paper analyzes the problem of inducing the members of an organization to behave as if they formed a team. Considered is a conglomerate-type organization consisting of a set of semi-autonomous subunits that are coordinated by the organization's head. The head's incentive problem is to choose a set of employee compensation rules that will induce his subunit managers to communicate accurate information and take optimal decisions. The main result exhibits a particular set of compensation rules, an optimal incentive structure, that leads to team behavior. Particular attention is directed to the informational aspects of the problem. An extended example of a resource allocation model is discussed and the optimal incentive structure is interpreted in terms of prices charged by the head for resources allocated to the subunits.},

Potentially morally injurious events, such as perpetrating, failing to prevent, or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations may be deleterious in the long-term, emotionally, psychologically, behaviorally, spiritually, and socially (what we label as moral injury). Although there has been some research on the consequences of unnecessary acts of violence in war zones, the lasting impact of morally injurious experience in war remains chiefly unaddressed. To stimulate a critical examination of moral injury, we review the available literature, define terms, and offer a working conceptual framework and a set of intervention strategies designed to repair moral injury."

Hence, it is impossible to find an incentive compatible mechanism with minimum social welfare losses. Furthermore, we discuss the compatibility problems between incentive and individual rights in a quasi-linear environment (see Sen, 1970a,b; Deb et al., 1997). Specifically, some new impossibility results are established."

This paper provides two simplified proofs for this. The first proof uses the same underlying key-point, but significantly simplifies the technical construction around it, thus helps to shed light on it. The second proof builds on monotonicity conditions identified by Rochet (J Math Econ 16:191-200, 1987) and Bikhchandani et al. (Econometrica 74(4):1109-1132, 2006).

The reason is partly that the moral principles that actually govern our day-to-day behavior have been idealized in a way that makes a natural origin seem impossible. This paper puts the case for a more down-to-earth assessment of human morality by arguing that the evolution of our sense of fairness can be traced to the practicalities of food-sharing. When animals share food, they can be seen as enjoying the fruits of an implicit bargain to ensure each other against hunger. The implications of this observation are explored using the tools of game theory. The arguments lead to a structure for fair bargains that closely resembles the structure proposed by John Rawls, the leading moral philosopher of the last century.},

 ISSN = {03038300, 15730921},
 abstract = {A crucial debate in policy-making as well as academic circles is whether there is a trade-off between economic efficiency and the size/generosity of the welfare state. One way to contribute to this debate is to compare the performance of 'best cases' of different types of state. Arguably, in the decade 1985-94, the US, West Germany and the Netherlands were 'best cases' - best economic performers - in what Esping-Andersen (1990) calls "the three worlds of welfare capitalism". The US is a liberal welfare-capitalist state, West Germany a corporatist state, and the Netherlands is social democratic in its tax-transfer system, although not its labor market policies. These three countries had rates of economic growth per capita as high or higher than other rich countries of their 'type', and the lowest rates of unemployment. At a normative or ideological level the three types of state have the same goals but prioritise them differently. The liberal state prioritises economic growth and efficiency, avoids work disincentives, and targets welfare benefits only to those in greatest need. The corporatist state aims to give priority to social stability, especially household income stability, and social integration. The social democratic welfare state claims high priority for minimising poverty, inequality and unemployment. Using ten years of panel data for each country, we assess indicators of their short (one year), medium (five year) and longer term (ten year) performance in achieving economic and welfare goals. Overall, in this time period, the Netherlands achieved the best performance on the welfare goals to which it gave priority, and equalled the other two states on most of the goals to which they gave priority. This result supports the view that there is no necessary trade-off between economic efficiency and a generous welfare state. The three panel studies are the American Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and the Dutch Socio-Economic Panel (SEP). They all have samples of over 15,000 and are the only national panels to have run for ten consecutive years or more, so making it possible to assess the longer term performance of welfare-capitalist states.},

  Abstract                 = {Selfish, strategic players may benefit from cooperation, provided they reach agreement. It is therefore important to construct mechanisms that facilitate such cooperation, especially in the case of asymmetric private information. The two major issues are: (1) singling out a fair and efficient outcome among the many individually rational possibilities in a strategic game, and (2) establishing a play protocol under which strategic players may achieve this outcome. The paper presents a general solution for two-person Bayesian games with monetary payoffs, under a strong revealed-payoff assumption. The proposed solution builds upon earlier concepts in game theory. It coincides with the von Neumann minmax value on the class of zero sum games and with the major solution concepts to the Nash Bargaining Problem. Moreover, the solution is based on a simple decomposition of every game into cooperative and competitive components, which is easy to compute.},

 abstract = {This paper concerns the two-stage game introduced in Nash (1953). It formalizes a suggestion made (but not pursued) by Nash regarding equilibrium selection in that game, and hence offers an arguably more solid foundation for the "Nash bargaining with endogenous threats" solution. Analogous reasoning is then applied to an infinite horizon game to provide equilibrium selection in two-person repeated games with contracts. In this setting, issues about enforcement of threats are much less problematic than in Nash's static setting. The analysis can be extended to stochastic games with contracts.},

This model allows us to compare two bargaining solutions that use reference points, the Gupta-Livne solution and the tempered aspirations solution, in terms of Pareto efficiency in a strategic framework. Our main result shows that the weights solutions place on the disagreement point do not directly imply a unique efficiency ranking in this bargaining problem with a reference point. In particular, the introduction of a reference point brings one more degree of freedom to the model which requires also the difference in the weights placed on the reference point to be considered in reaching an efficiency ranking.},

  Abstract                 = {The nature of the problems investigated and the techniques employed in this book necessitate a procedure which in many instances is thoroughly mathematical. The mathematical devices used are elementary in the sense that no advanced algebra, or calculus, etc., occurs. (With two, rather unimportant, exceptions: Part of the discussion of an example in 19.7. et sequ. and a remark in A.3.3. make use of some simple integrals.) Concepts originating in set theory, linear geometry and group theory play an important role, but they are invariably taken from the early chapters of those disciplines and are moreover analyzed and explained in special expository sections. Nevertheless the book is not truly elementary because the mathematical deductions are frequently intricate and the logical possibilities are extensively exploited. Thus no specific knowledge of any particular body of advanced mathematics is required. However, the reader who wants to acquaint himself more thoroughly with the subject expounded here, will have to familiarize himself with the mathematical way of reasoning definitely beyond its routine, primitive phases. The character of the procedures will be mostly that of mathematical logics, set theory and functional analysis. We have attempted to present the subject in such a form that a reader who is moderately versed in mathematics can acquire the necessary practice in the course of this study. We hope that we have not entirely failed in this endeavour. In accordance with this, the presentation is not what it would be in a strictly mathematical treatise. All definitions and deductions are considerably broader than they would be there. Besides, purely verbal discussions and analyses take up a considerable amount of space. We have in particular tried to give, whenever possible, a parallel verbal exposition for every major mathematical deduction. It is hoped that this procedure will elucidate in unmathematical language what the mathematical technique signifies-and will also show where it achieves more than can be done without it. ! In this, as well as in our methodological stand, we are trying to follow the best examples of theoretical physics. The reader who is not specifically interested in mathematics should at first omit those sections of the book which in his judgment are too mathematical. We prefer not to give a definite list of them, since this judgment must necessarily be subjective. However, those sections marked with an asterisk in the table of contents are most likely to occur to the average reader inthis connection. At any rate he will find that these omissions will little interfere with the comprehension of the early parts, although the logical chain may in the rigorous sense have suffered an interruption. As he proceeds the omissions will gradually assume a more serious character and the lacunae in the deduction will become more and more significant. The reader is then advised to start again from the beginning since the greater familiarity acquired is likely to facilitate a better understanding.},

  Abstract                 = {We calculate the electricity prices that would result from a pure "poolco" market with identical profit-maximizing generating firms. We advance theoretical concepts developed by Klemperer and Meyer (1989) and Green and Newbery (1992), and propose a new formula for the instantaneous market clearing price when generating firms adopt bidding strategies given by the Nash Equilibrium. Applying this formula to empirical electricity supply and demand data, we find that even in markets with a relatively high number of firms, the price of electricity is significantly higher than the short-run marginal cost of generation. We express the average annual price mark-up with a Price-Cost Margin Index, and show how it varies with market concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI). We conclude that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's use of the HHI in its merger guidelines could prove inadequate in addressing market power concerns in deregulated poolco markets.}

A game of threats is not necessarily a coalitional game as it may fail to satisfy the condition d(∅)=0. We show that analogs of the classic Shapley axioms for coalitional games determine a unique value for games of threats. This value assigns to each player an average of d(S) across all the coalitions that include the player. Games of threats arise naturally in value theory for strategic games, and may have applications in other branches of game theory.},

Min-max problems such that the minimizer makes an optimal decision against the worst case that might be chosen by the maximizer are studied. This paper presents necessary conditions and computational methods for a min-max solution (not a saddle point solution). Those conditions are stated in a form like Kuhn-Tucker theorem. The computational methods are based on the relaxation procedure. A min-max problem such that the minimizer and the maximizer are subject to separate constraints is primarily studied. But it is shown that the obtained results can be applied for the unseparate constraint case by use of duality theory.}},

  Abstract                 = {Mechanism design is an analytical framework for thinking clearly and carefully about what exactly a given institution can achieve when the information necessary to make decisions is dispersed and privately held. This analysis provides an account of the underlying mathematics of mechanism design based on linear programming. Three advantages characterize the approach. The first is simplicity: arguments based on linear programming are both elementary and transparent. The second is unity: the machinery of linear programming provides a way to unify results from disparate areas of mechanism design. The third is reach: the technique offers the ability to solve problems that appear to be beyond solutions offered by traditional methods. No claim is made that the approach advocated should supplant traditional mathematical machinery. Rather, the approach represents an addition to the tools of the economic theorist who proposes to understand economic phenomena through the lens of mechanism design.}

  Abstract                 = {Under conditions of imperfect competition, the issue of asymmetric information, which has not been effectively managed and settled until now, has been one of the most significant problems of the pool-based electricity market, both in theory and practice. Electricity generation companies expect to maximize their profits and control the market price by strategically bidding and their offers will necessarily deviate from the true marginal costs. These practices would result in great losses of market efficiency and incur much more payments from the consumers than actually needed. Therefore, this paper uses the analytical paradigm of economic mechanism design theory to deduce and design a customized pool-based market mechanism, which simultaneously satisfies three major properties of mechanism design theory: incentive compatibility, individual rationality and payment cost minimization. Then, several issues associated with the operational principle and implementation of this innovative mechanism are discussed and examined in detail. Finally, the results of numerical examples and case study validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, which can encourage truthfulness and eliminate tacit collusion, even when there is a tight market or transmission congestion with pivotal suppliers.},

In this experimental study, the participants share a loss in a Nash bargaining game, but waiting time, instead of monetary losses, serves as an incentive. Further, we assume that the participants prefer less, rather than more, waiting time. Our experiment consists of four versions of the Nash bargaining game to allow for a comparison of four classical negotiation concepts (Nash, equal loss, equal gain, and Kalai–Smorodinsky) and an equal split of the overall waiting time. Our experimental evidence shows that an equal split better predicts the outcome of a Nash bargaining game involving losses than classical concepts do. Furthermore, the findings support that the participants resort to equal splits at the cost of their overall welfare."

Specifically, it presents: (1) a decomposition of a game into cooperative and competitive components, (2) an intuitive and computable closed-form formula for the solution, (3) an axiomatic justification of the solution, and (4) a generalization of the solution to games with private signals, along with an arbitration scheme that implements it.

This agreement may be construed as the limit of a sequence of partial agreements, each of which is reached as a function of the parties' relative power in the non-cooperative scenario.},

We consider strategyproof budget-balanced mechanisms with bounded valuations that are approximately efficient. We show that a deterministic, strategyproof, and budget-balanced mechanism must have a sink whose valuation is ignored in the decision, and is compensated with all the leftover money. We find a tight lower bound on the inefficiencies of strategyproof, budget-balanced mechanisms using this result. The bound shows that the inefficiency asymptotically disappears when the number of agents is large—we provide worst-case bounds and the best possible rate of convergence. We provide results for convex combination of inefficiency and budget imbalance and for randomized mechanisms. Experiments with real data from two applications show that the inefficiency for a simple randomized mechanism is 5–100 times smaller than the worst case."

In many countries, they are procured through a market mechanism in which entities provide bids. The system operator determines the accepted bids based on an optimization algorithm. We develop the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism for these electricity markets. We show that all advantages of the VCG mechanism including incentive compatibility of the equilibria and efficiency of the outcome can be guaranteed in these markets. Furthermore, we derive conditions to ensure collusion and shill bidding are not profitable. Our results are verified with numerical examples."

  Abstract                 = {A wide collection of popular statistical learning methods, ranging from K-means to Support Vector Machines through Neural Networks, can be formulated as a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm in a specific setup. In practice, the main limitation of this incremental optimization technique is due to the stochastic noise induced by the choice at random of the data involved in the gradient estimate computation at each iteration. It is the purpose of this paper to introduce a novel implementation of the SGD algorithm, where the data subset used at a given step is not picked uniformly at random among all possible subsets but drawn from a specific adaptive sampling scheme, depending on the past iterations in a Markovian manner, in order to refine the current statistical estimation of the gradient. Beyond an algorithmic description of the approach we propose, rate bounds are established and illustrative numerical results are displayed in order to provide theoretical and empirical evidence of its statistical performance, compared to more ``naive'' SGD implementations. Computational issues are also discussed at length, revealing the practical advantages of the method promoted.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a stratified sampling algorithm in which the random drawings made in the strata to compute the expectation of interest are also used to adaptively modify the proportion of further drawings in each stratum. These proportions converge to the optimal allocation in terms of variance reduction and our stratified estimator is asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance equal to the minimal one. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of our algorithm. For the pricing of arithmetic average Asian options in the Black and Scholes model, the variance is divided by a factor going from 1.1 to 50.4 (depending on the option type and the moneyness) in comparison with the standard allocation procedure, while the increase in computation time does not overcome 1{\%}.},

The cohort is stratified according to the correlate, and the subcohort is selected by stratified random sampling. A number of possible methods for the analysis of such exposure stratified case-cohort samples are presented, some of their statistical properties developed, and approximate relative efficiency and optimal allocation to the strata discussed. The methods are compared to each other, and to randomly sampled case-cohort studies, in a limited computer simulation study. We found that all of the proposed analysis methods performed well and were more efficient than a randomly sampled case-cohort study.},

  Abstract                 = {The infinite dimensional Z-estimation theorem offers a systematic approach to joint estimation of both Euclidean and non-Euclidean parameters in probability models for data. It is easily adapted for stratified sampling designs. This is important in applications to censored survival data because the inverse probability weights that modify the standard estimating equations often depend on the entire follow-up history. Since the weights are not predictable, they complicate the usual theory based on martingales. This paper considers joint estimation of regression coefficients and baseline hazard functions in the Cox proportional and Lin--Ying additive hazards models. Weighted likelihood equations are used for the former and weighted estimating equations for the latter. Regression coefficients and baseline hazards may be combined to estimate individual survival probabilities. Efficiency is improved by calibrating or estimating the weights using information available for all subjects. Although inefficient in comparison with likelihood inference for incomplete data, which is often difficult to implement, the approach provides consistent estimates of desired population parameters even under model misspecification.},

Two sampling schemes are discussed in connection with the problem of determining optimum selection probabilities according to the information available in a supplementary variable. Admittedly, these two schemes have limited application. They should prove useful, however, for the first stage of sampling with multi-stage designs, since both permit unbiased estimation of the sampling variance without resorting to additional assumptions.},

Simulation studies show that the proposed test for the SCC design utilizing small sub-cohort sampling fractions is valid and efficient for situations where the disease rate is low. Furthermore, optimization of sampling in the SCC design is discussed and compared with proportional and balanced sampling techniques. An epidemiological study is provided to illustrate the sample size calculation under the SCC design.},

  Abstract                 = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

The electricity grid is seen as an evolving system of increasingly interconnected and complex devices, providing a structured platform for the exchange of power and services between people.
However at the heart of this evolving construction there is a morally ambiguous question - how should it be determined how much people \textit{should} pay or be-paid for the power they consume or generate?

Or, to ask the question with more granularity: when the possible power-flows on an electricity network are valued and influenced by participants differently, 
what is a reasonable cooperative outcome for the network and what monetary transactions should occur between the participants in that case? -- and this is to ask: how should electricity be traded?\\

We review the ethical considerations that frame the question, then proceed to give a novel solution concept for the question, which we compare against others. in their implementation and consequences.\\

We also develop some statistics used for the computation.

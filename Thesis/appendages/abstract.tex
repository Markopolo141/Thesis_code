The electricity grid is an evolving system of increasingly interconnected and complex devices, providing a structured platform for the exchange of power and services between people.
However at the heart of this evolving construction there is a morally ambiguous question - how should it be determined how much \textit{should} people pay or be-paid between themself for the power they consume or generate for each other?
This is to ask - how should electricity be traded?

We review the ethical considerations that frame the question, before we give consideration of a range of background solutions to the problem.
Then we proceed to give a novel solution concept for the question called the `GNK value', which we compare against others.
We investigate the implementation and consequences of different solutions for large scale networks under DC-approximation powerflows, where it is found that our novel solution unfortunately fails some ethical requirements.

We then conclude by presenting a sophisticated and novel method of stratified sampling that was developed for approximating the GNK value for larger networks.
